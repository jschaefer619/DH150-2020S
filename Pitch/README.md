### Introduction

This project is both a redesign of the UCLA Radio website and an exploration on the role of community media today.

Its focus is inspired by my continuing role as the Programming Manager of UCLA Radio. I believe that a redesign of the UCLA Radio website would greatly improve the user experience of the platform. 

### Design Statement

 Writing this in June 2020, it is especially apparent that top-down homogeneous corporate media outlets do not tell the people's story. There needs to be a media platform that is run by people and for people.

UCLA Radio has excellent content and passionate DJ's. But it's interface is dated and, at times, downright confusing.

**It is time to bring college radio, a platform with a longstanding grassroots heritage, into the 21st century to fill this niche in community media.**

### Competitor Analysis

Heuristic evaluations are quick ways for designers to evaluate the [usability of a product.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

A heuristic evaluation was conducted on the [UCLA Radio website](https://uclaradio.com) and the [KXLU (LMU's college radio) website.](https://kxlu.com) Some major problem areas with the UCLA Radio website included:
 - Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: The landing page is cluttered and dated. The aesthetic needs to be updated accordingly
 - Flexibility & efficiency of use: There needs to be search features implemented for the "Shows" page, and filters would be effective for sorting through show content.
 - Visibility of System Status: Increased functionality for the streaming function - which shows is playing, what DJ, prior songs, etc.
 
 KXLU suffered from some similar issues, but did excel in its aesthetic and minimalist design - it served as a design inspiration in this regard. [Read more on Heuristic Evaluation...](https://github.com/jschaefer619/DH150-2020S/tree/master/Assignment01:%20Heuristic%20Evaluation)
 
 User Testing of the UCLA Radio Website confirmed many of the issues raised during the heuristic analysis. [Read more on User Testing...](https://github.com/jschaefer619/DH150-2020S/tree/master/Assignment%2002:%20Pilot%20User%20Testing)
 
 ### User Research
 
 User research is a way for designers to engage with real users and uncover their desires, problems, and ideas associated with their potential product.

The interview with a user from our target demographic (digitally literate college student) yielded some useful insights. They expressed that the content of UCLA Radio occupies a different niche than traditional streaming services and traditional media out. Rather than compete directly with platforms like Spotify or Amazon Music, UCLA Radio should highlight the unique perspectives of college students, their unconventional music tastes, and experimental forms of radio programming.
 
 Our user also expressed the desire for filtering and more effective navigation for the show page. [Read more on Contextual Inquiry...](https://github.com/jschaefer619/DH150-2020S/tree/master/Assignment%2004:%20Contextual%20Inquiry)
 
 ### UX Storytelling 
 
 UX Storytelling is a method for designer to engage with hypothetical users and anticipate their needs.
 
 From User Research, three personas, tasks, and features were reciprocally developed. 
  - 'Emma' is a LA newcomer and second year UCLA student who wants to discover new music to add to her existing Spotify playlists. This persona inspired the Spotify DJ feature.
  - 'Chuck' is a former college radio DJ with a daughter involved in College radio - as such, he wants to support his daughter's endeavor and college radio holistically. He would like to find the showtime of his daughter's show. This persona inspired new DJ search / show integration feature, as well as a new donate feature.
  - 'Lee' is a current Radio DJ and would like to increase engagement with her audience. This persona inspired a more comprehensive chat feature.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

A wireframe is a quick and easily iterable way of allowing potential users to test designs. Potential layouts and features can be implemented, tested, and redesigned through wireframes.

#### Low-fidelity Prototype

The features developed in the prior stage of user testing were demo'd through a drawn wireframe. The reorganization of old features and implementation of the features tested well with users.

#### High-Fidelity Prototype 

A Figma high-fidelity prototype further developed the low-fidelity prototype. Much time was dedicated to refining the aesthetics of the webpage. Interaction points were clearly communicated to the user through highlighting and underlining text. Color contrast testing was performed, and more.

### Evaluation and Revision History

This prototype was then presented to users for impression testing and a cognitive walkthrough. Users were able to complete the three tasks of our user personas effectively, and the overall impression of the redesign was positive. However there were improvements to be made. Images associated with certain shows were made interactive to suit the user's initial impulses. These changes were swiftly implemented. Further improvements could be made to improve contrast of text over gradients.

### Conclusion

The prototype tested effectively and fostered a pleasant user experience. The biggest challenge of this redesign was updating the aesthetics of the webpage, and to that end, this redesign was a success. But further developments on this prototype could include bolder visions for the potential of community media. The improved chat feature tested effectively, but there remains potential for further DJ - listener interaction affordances. More robust user testing with college aged users could reveal more insights in this regard.

Personally, as a member of UCLA Radio, this project was satisfing. The quick and iterative nature of UI/UX research is very engaging. I learned much about the functionality and potential of Figma. Thank you to Dr. Sookie for her guidance throughout this project.
