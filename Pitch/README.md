## UCLA Radio: Community Building Through Community Media

### Introduction

This project is both redesign of the UCLA Radio website and a meditation on the role of community media today.

This redesign of UCLA Radio website is an attempt to realize the potential of community media. The aesthetic is modernized. Navigation is smoother. There are pragmatic search features and filters. New affordances facilitate deeper DJ - listener communication, and highlight the DJ's role as a musical tastemaker. 

### Design Statement

 Writing this in June of 2020, it is especially apparent that top-down homogenous corporate media outlets do not tell the people's story. There needs to be a media platform that is run by people and for people.

UCLA Radio has excellent content and passionate DJ's. But it's interface is dated and, at times, downright confusing.

It is time to bring college radio, a platform with a longstanding grassroots heritage, into the 21st century to fill this niche. 

### Competitor Analysis

Heuristic evaluations are quick ways for designers to evalute the usability of a product.

A heursitic evaluation was conducted on the UCLA Radio website and the KXLU (LMU's college radio) website. Some major problem areas with the UCLA Radio website included:
 - Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: The landing page is cluttered and dated. The aesthetic needs to be updated accordingly
 - Flexibility & efficiency of use: There need to be search features implemented for the "Shows" page, and filters would be effective for sorting through show content.
 - Visibility & System Status: Increased functionality for the streaming function - which shows is playing, what DJ, prior songs, etc.
 
 KXLU suffered from some similar issues, but did excel in the aesthetic and Minimalist design - it served as a design inspiration in this regard.
 
 ### User Research
 
 User reasearch is a way for designers to engage with real users and uncover their desires, problems, and ideas associated with your potential product.
 
 The interview with a user from our target demographic (digitally literate college student) yielded some useful insights. They expressed that the content of UCLA Radio occupies a different niche than traditional streaming services and traditional media. Rather than compete directly with platforms like Spotify or Amazon Music, UCLA Radio should highlight unique perspective of college students, their unconventional music tastes, and experimental forms of radio programming.
 
 Our user also expressed the desire for filtering and more effective navigation for the show page.
 
 ### UX Storytelling 
 
 UX Storytelling is a method for designer to engage with hypothetical users and anticipate their needs.
 
 From User Research, three personas, tasks, and features were reciprocally developed. 
  - 'Emma' is a LA newcomer and second year UCLA student who wants to discover new music to add to her existing spotify playlists. This persona inspired the spotify DJ feature
  - 'Chuck' is a former college radio DJ with a daughter involved in College radio - as such, he wants to support his daughter and college radio. He would like to find the showtime of his daughter's show. This persona inspired new DJ search / show integration features, as well as a new donate affordance.
  - 'Lee' is a current Radio DJ and would like to increase engagement with her audience. This persona inspired a more comprehensive chat feature.
  
### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

A wireframe is a quick and easily iterable way of allowing potential users to test designs. Potential layouts and features can be implemented, tested, and redesigned through wireframes.

#### Low-fidelity Prototype

The features developed in the prior stage of user testing were demo'd through a low fidelity drawn wireframe. The reorganization, redesign of the new features tested well with users. Thus, it was time to further develop the prototype.

#### High-Fidelity Prototype 

The high fidelity protype furthered development of the low-fidelity iterations. Much time was dedicated to refining the aesthetics of the webpage. Interaction points were clearly communicated to the user through highlighting and underlining features on text. Color contrast testing was performed. 

### Evaluation and Revision History

This prototype was then presented to users for impression testing and a cognitive walkthrough. Users were able to complete the three tasks of our user personas effectively, and the overall impression of the redesign was positive. However there were improvements to be made. Images associated with certain shows were made interactive to suit the user's initial impulses. These changes were swiftly implemented. Further improvements could be made to contrast of text over gradients.

### Conclusion

The prototype tested effectively and fostered a pleasant user experience. The biggest challenge of this redesign was updating the aesthetics of the webpage, and to that end, this redesign was a sucess. But further developments on this prototype could include bolder visions for the potential of community media. The improved chat feature tested effectively, but there remains potential for further DJ - listener interaction affordances. More robust user testing with college aged users could reveal more insights in this vein.

Personally, as a member of UCLA Radio, this project was very satisfing. The quick and iterative nature of UI/UX research is very engaging. I learned much about the functionality and potential of figma. Thank you to Dr. Sookie for her guidance throughout this project.
