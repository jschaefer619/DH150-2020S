# Potential Project Name: Community Building through community-centered media

## Introduction: Statement of Purpose

#### Former president Bill Clinton spoke fondly of communitarianism as the philosphical bedrock for a more interconnected, responsible community. Loosely, communitarianism views the community itself as the fundamental politcal unit. Fostering trust, togetherness,and belonging between neighboors was a pathway to combat rising national partisanship.

#### This focus on the communinity isn't reflected in the diversity or focus of our media outlets, which are becoming increasingly homogenized through corporate consolidation.

#### College radio stations are community focused in their design. Their members are composed entirely of students, faculty, and community figures. Local artists and stories are promoted. They are not held accountable to the demands of advertisers. College radio stations are a platform for the people, no strings attatched.

#### However, Radio is an aging medium. Terrestrial Radio stations and conventional radio programming may be diminishing in relevance. However, there is still a hunger for audio-based media. Podcasts are surging in popularity. Stations can post curated spotify or Apple Music playlists for users.

#### A website that is usable, enticing, and engaging can catapult college radio into the 21st century. But for this to happen, great *design* is neccessary.

#### As a member of the college radio community, I am driven to better the impact of college radio, and other community focused media outlets through an understanding of UI/UX principles. I will use Jakob Nielson's 10 usability heuristics to evaluate two college radio websites.

## *Assignment One: Heuristic Evaluation*

### Website One: [UCLA Radio](https://uclaradio.com)

#### *Description*: UCLA Radio's website is the primary platform for engaging with UCLA Radio content. UCLA Radio is not terrestrial - there is no AM or FM signal broadcast - instead, it's primary broadcast is accessible online through a live stream. As such, the live stream is the focus of the website. Other features include a DJ section, a \'shows\' section, a blog, an about section, an events section, and a link to apply to the organization.

#### *Brief Evaluation and Motivation* : UCLA Radio has a strong social media presence, and there is a nice synergy here with the website's immediately communicated links to various social media outlets. Additionally, there is a strong and active blog, though it's content is not communicated well to the user. The show panel is lacking in presentation and consistency. Much to the detriment of the overall user experience, many features have not been maintained or updated in over a year. This makes the experience alientating to the new user. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic is dated and cluttered. But as a member of this community, I hope to better understand and improve the user experience through this evaluation.

### Heuristic One: Visiblity of system status

* Many features will highlight when scrolled over. Though this is a basic form of feedback, it is a good.
* Tabs on the website, such as 'DJs' or 'blog' remain highlighted when the user is on a given page, assisting navigation.
* There is a 'loading' graphic that is displayed when features such as the blog or the shows pages are being loaded. This is a useful progress indicator. However, there have been multiple instances where the loading animation never ends, and the user must reload the page. *See below*

![loading icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78820196-3e8c8400-798c-11ea-81c6-8043448df1e7.png)

* Perhaps most dissapointingly for a music outlet, there is no data on display for which song is currently being broadcast. Instead, the stream simply says "LIVE STREAM." This is unacceptable for a radio outlet of this type - one that could serve as a music tastemaker. *See below*

* *Severity Rating 3*

### Heuristic Two: Match Between System and Real World

* Generally, the website suceeds here. There is no technical jargon, except where it's use is warranted. All of the terms on the main website are understandable to it's target demographic.

* *Severity Rating 0*

### Heuristic Three: User Control and Freedom

* The website is simple enough for the user to navigate between many features without being forced into unwarrented wait times
* One problematic feature is the presence of a button that allows users to see the "old blog." Upon clicking this feature, users are taken to an old website that, while resembling the aesthetic of the new website, has entirely different content and layout. The only way to return to primary website is to click on the UCLA Radio icon, or use the back button on a web browser. These flaws would be much more forgiving if this old blog looked truly distinct from the new website, but instead it occupies this uncanny middleground between the old/new website. This is confusing to users and limits their freedom to return to the original website. *See this feature below*

![Screen Shot 2020-04-08 at 12 03 13 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78823095-fc197600-7990-11ea-87c7-572d888d62cd.png)

* *Severity Rating 3*

### Heuristic Four: Consistency and Standards

* Generally, the website does not deviate from any major web conventions. There are a few small issues.
* Surprisingly, there is no apparent \'contact\' feature on the landing page. Instead, the user must go through the 'about' page to get contact info for stations management. This is slightly unconventional in this context - many artists visit this page in a effort to promote thier work. Conventions, such as a 'contact' page should be used here. Furthermore, there is no obvious, consistent way to contact individual DJ's. Some have info listed, but many do not.

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Five: Error Prevention

* Reiterating on what was stated in heuristic three, the website does not communicate that the old blog will not provide a clearly communicated way to return to the original website after visiting the old blog. A brief message indicating that the user is 'leaving' the original website may be useful here.
* Similarly, the 'apply' link takes the user to the student media web page without warning.

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Six: Recognition Rather than Recall

* When searching for a given Dj using the search bar, the roster of DJ's does narrow down with respect to the user's search. This is helpful, as the user may know the first few characters of a given DJ then recognize thier face or selected DJ icon.
* However, there is no synergy between the DJ page and the show schedule page. So, a user will have to either remember when a given DJ's showtime is, or scan the poorly layed out show page until finding their respective show. 

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Seven: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

* Many of the above points are echoed here. The search feature for DJ's allows for more efficient use. A newcomer is free to browse the DJ galleries if they desire.
* A similar search feature is incorporated in the 'blog' website section
* The absense of this search feature for showtimes is very undesirable. Again, the user will have to remember a given showtime to find more show info when navigating the 'shows' page

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Eight: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

* The landing page of the website is disappointing. It is cluttered with old blog posts layed out in a series of blocks. UCLA Radio has a thriving youtube channel with great videos of in station performances. As evidenced on the new blog, talented photographers document local concerts. Visually appealing content such as this should be the first thing new users see when visiting the webpage.
* The banner at the top of the web page could display useful information about upcoming events or announcements. A major one could be how programming has changed in the wake of COVID-19. However, it instead alternates betweeen two banners that provide no substantive information about the station. Wasted space.
* The "shows" section of the website is a very inefficent use of a lot of space. Furthermore, there are many black slots where automated programming plays instead of a radio show. These spaces should have some sort of icon to assist in the aesthetic of the page. *See below*

![shows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78826796-faeb4780-7996-11ea-97df-8c83d15c9086.png)

* *Severity Rating 3*

### Heuristic Nine: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

* Upon searching for various DJ's, there is no message to indicate that the search resulted in no findings, just a blank interface. A brief message prompting the user to check for spelling, or try the preface 'DJ' before thier query would help in this situation.

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Ten: Help and Documentation

* Under the 'Stream' page, there is information on how to fix problems with the stream and other website features. Although reloading the webpage will fix errors, it is still a very undesirable solution. Rather than reload the webpage multiple times, the user may simply visit another more functional website.
* Related to heuristic four, it is unclear why there is a 'stream' page that really only contains information on resolving website issues. A different title for this page may be more appropriate. *See below*

![ucla error recovery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78827068-66351980-7997-11ea-82e8-13091e2f7f47.png)

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Website Two: [KXLU](https://kxlu.com)

#### *Description*: KXLU.com is the companion website to the terrestrial 88.9 FM Radio station. This is also a college radio station for Loyola Marimount Univeristy. It many of the same features as UCLA Radio's website\: there is a livestream, blog, events page, DJ page, etc. 

#### *Brief Evaluation and Motivation*: KXLU has a great, modern aesthetic to their website. Clearly, there was a sizable budget allocated to updating and mantaining this website. However, some features have also been neglected by content creators, and some of the actions take users to confusing sister websites. Some fine-tuning would go a long way. With KXLU positioned as a 'rival' station to UCLA Radio, I believe it would be fruitful to understand where it's design choices suceed and where it falls flat.

![kxlu landing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78828056-f58efc80-7998-11ea-9764-8a022cbab06d.png)

### Heuristic One: Visiblity of system status

* There is responsive action when interactive parts of the website are scrolled over with the mouse.
* Similar to UCLA Radio, the livestream does not display any information about which song is being played. Very undesirable for a college radio station.

* *Severity Rating 3*

### Heuristic Two: Match Between System and Real World

* Generally, the website suceeds here. There is no technical jargon, except where it's use is warranted. All of the terms on the main website are understandable to it's target demographic.

* *Severity Rating 0*

### Heuristic Three: User control and freedom

* Many features on the website are easily navigated by the user without much wait time.
* The following design flaw may be relevant to several heuristics, but is worth describing here. Whenever a new section of the website is loaded, such as going from the \'about\' page to the \'blog' page, the entire website is reloaded. Thus, the stream is effectively stopped then restarted, causing a very undesirable pause for the users listening experience. Users may hesistate to explore other of the website, knowing that the stream will be interrupted. One can resolve this issue by using a linked external streaming platform, which is communicated adequately to the user - but this solution could be stressed more.
* Clicking on \' playlist\' feature under the \'DJs\' header directs the user to the KXLU "spintron" companion website. This feature is useful, but is also challenging for users to navigate back to the KXLU website. At the very least, a new tab could be generated instead of replacing the user\'s current window. *See spintron website below*

* *Severity Rating 3*

### Heuristic Four: Consistency and Standards

* The website adheres to most web conventions.
* At the bottom of the website page, there are a series of links that reiterate some major features of the website. Some new names and catagories are used here. For instance, a \'happenings\' tab recategorizes the events and blog page under this heading. This is a minor change in the consistency to redress some of the website\'s features, and this is acceptable.

![Screen Shot 2020-04-08 at 1 36 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78831148-02621f00-799e-11ea-82b6-c5475dca5640.png)

* *Severity Rating 0*

### Heuristic Five: Error Prevention

* Under the \'Events\' section of the website, there is a search feature for finding various events. The \'date\' feature is nicely implemented through a calendar like time, preventing users from inputting an erroneous time. *See below image*
* It should be notes that the content of the events feature was lacking. There were no events listed in the next three months.

![kxlu events feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78831996-620cfa00-799f-11ea-937b-d1421d9f89c0.png)

* *Severity Rating 1*

### Heuristic Six: Recognition Rather than Recall

* The DJ pages supports recognition over recall through having the pictures/icons of DJ's prominently displayed. Thus, users do not have to neccessarily know a full DJ name to locate the desired DJ.
* However, the above feature\'s use is limited. Not all DJ\'s on the schedule are listed on the DJ page. This could make it challenging for the user to find the showtime of a given unlisted DJ.

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Seven: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

* Unfortunately, there is no way for users to search for a given DJ or show without scanning through those respective webpages.
* There is a useful catagorization feature for the blog, helping users sort articles by type. Perhaps a similar solution could be applied to other aspects of the website.

* *Severity Rating 2*

### Heuristic Eight: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

* KXLU suceeds here. Space is well utilized and filled with relevant features.
* The aesthetic is modernized, utilizing a clean gray color pallette, while also calling back to the roots of college radio. Retro film photos of the station and members decorate the background, effectively conveying the rich tradition of college radio as an essential tastemaker within the music community.

* *Severity Rating 0*

### Heuristic Nine: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

* Referring back to the events page, there is a useful notification telling the users that their events-related query yielded no results.
* A helpuful feature, but unfortunate that there are little to no events listed.

![events error message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56604738/78833648-11e36700-79a2-11ea-9fd4-8d4a76c1800a.png)

* *Severity Rating 1*

### Heuristic Ten: Help and Documentation

* In place of a help feature, there is a well-communicated \'contact\' page on the website, which has information for reaching various staff members.
* Perhaps an alternative could be implemented to recieve on the spot help for certain issues. An \'FAQ\' page could be helpful for users to recieve immediate feedback for various questions.

* *Severity Rating 1*
