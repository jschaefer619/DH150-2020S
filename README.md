## Introduction: Statement of Purpose

#### Former president Bill Clinton spoke fondly of communitarism as the phiolosphical bedrock for a more interconnected, responsible community. Loosely, communitarism viewed the community itself as the fundamental politcal unit. Fostering trust, togetherness,and belonging between neighboors was a pathway to combat rising national partisanship.

#### This focus on the communinity in't reflected in the diversity or focus of our media outlets, which are becoming increasingly homogenized through corporate consolidation.

#### College radio stations are community focused in their design. Their members are composed entirely of students, faculty, and community figures. Local artists and stories are promoted. They are not held accountable to the demands of advertisers. College radio stations are a platform for the people, no strings attatched.

#### However, Radio is an aging medium. Terrestrial Radio stations and conventional radio programming may be diminishing in relevance. However, there is still a hunger for audio-based media. Podcasts are surging in popularity. Stations can post curated spotify or Apple Music playlists for users.

#### A website that is usable, enticing, and engaging can catapult college radio into the 21st century. But for this to happen, great design is neccessary.

## *Assignment One: Heuristic Evaluation*

### Website One: [UCLA Radio](https://uclaradio.com)

#### UCLA Radio's website is the primary platform for engaging with UCLA Radio content. UCLA Radio is not terrestrial - there is no AM or FM signal broadcast - instead, it's primary broadcast is accessible online through a live stream. As such, the live stream is the focus of the website. Other features include a DJ section, a 'shows' section, a blog, an about section, an events section, and a link to apply to the organization.

### *Brief Evaluation* UCLA Radio has a strong social media presence, and there is a nice synergy here with the website's immediate links to various social media outlets. Additionally, there is a strong and active blog, though it's content is not communicated well to the user. The show panel is lacking in presentation and consistency. Much to the detriment of the overall user experience, many features have not been maintained or updated in over a year. This makes the experience alientating to the new user. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic is dated and cluttered.

### Heuristic One: Visiblity of system status

* Many features will highlight when scrolled over. Though this is a basic form of feedback, it is a good.
* Tabs on the website, such as 'shows' or 'blog' remain highlighted when the user is on a given page, assisting navigation.

* Perhaps most dissapointingly for a music outlet, there is no data on display for which song is currently being broadcast. Instead, the stream simply says "LIVE STREAM" when being played. This is unacceptable for a radio outlet of this type - one that could serve as a music tastemaker. *See below*
