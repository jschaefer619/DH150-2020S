# Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Prototype

### By Jack Schaefer

## Description

Our user personas, and their respective were inspired and developed from the findings during our User Testing and analysis, as well as our User research. There were some relevant usability problems with the UCLA Radio website. These included a cluttered home screen, and unintuitive shows panel, underdeveloped community features, and a poor syntonization with other music platforms.


The *purpose* of the low-fidelity prototype is to use a quick method - sketches on paper - to test redesigns and features of the platform with feedback from users of the target demographic.  

Here are the user personas, their goals, and their tasks within this lo-fidelity setting.

#### Emma
**Goal** - Find a platform that supports and allows her to support and engage with the local artistic community  
**Task** - Discover new electronic music, then add music to her Spotify playlist  

#### Chuck
**Goal** - Support both hist daughter's artistic endeavors and independent radio stations  
**Task** - Find the showtime of his daughter's show  

#### Lee
**Goal** - Leverage the features of the UCLA Radio Website to promote her content  
**Task** - (As a fan of her show) Login to the account portal, then leave a comment on Lee's show  

## Wireframes

Scanned wireframes can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DGCiaWU4Pmf33e2pjr7ZMAGdQdktEJh_).  

A test user performed all of the above tasks in the Wireframe. They used a marker to track their navigation relative to each task. They used...

Green for Task One.
Yellow for Task Two.
Blue for Task Three.

The marked wireframes after testing can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ICOGOzQeRo7S56xvvpEiquroWzgaK4c5/view?usp=sharing).

### Wireframe Testing Evaluation

**Task One: Discover new electronic music, then add music to Spotify playlist**  

The task went smoothly. Our user was able to navigate to the show panel without much delay. From there, our user was directed to the show page. They were able to identify and click on the electronic filter. From there, the user clicked on an isolated show description, and then the imbedded Spotify playlist feature was utilized.

**Task Two: Find the showtime of daughter's show**

This task also went smoothly. Our user, once again, navigated to the show panel. They then recognized the search feature present in the show panel because of the magnifying glass icon and recognizable search bar. By typing in the desired name, the shows were filtered down. The showtime was then present in the filtered shows. 

**Task Three: (As a fan of her show) Login to the account portal, then leave a comment on Lee's show**
 
No problems here either. The icon and the top right of the landing page correctly directed the user to the simplified account portal. The use than entered their login information and returned to the landing page. Then, our user identified the icon to utilize the chat feature nearby the stream. They clicked on that, then were able to correctly utilize the chat interface to leave a comment.

## Reflection

This fidelity testing was a success, and serves as a proof of concept to further develop this type of wireframe. By abiding to accepted conventions of the web navigation through commonly understood icons(Neilson Normal Usability Heuristic #4) our user was able to effectively navigate the wireframe. This wireframe also addresses some of the biggest issues which surfaced during prior research: The landing page is uncluttered, the show panel is much less overwhelming and has appropriate filters and search features, and the Spotify integration serves to solidify UCLA Radio's status as a tastemaker during the era of digital music.

I will continue to flesh out these features and iterate upon them in the high fidelity prototype.
