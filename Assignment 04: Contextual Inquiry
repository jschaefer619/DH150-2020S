# Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry

### By Jack Schaefer

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the user in accomplishing?

Users will be able to connect with their community through community focused and community created media. This projects aims to provide Users / community members with local and global coverage from local perspectives, provide a platform for civil public discourse, and provide awareness of local arts and events.

Though this concept can be generalized, this project will be focused on the development of a college radio station to serve these aforementioned needs.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

This project will fulfill the users need for *Love/belonging*. A strong community fosters a strong sense of belonging. Furthermore, for especially involved community members who produce content or facilitate the media, this project will foster their self-actualization: this project will serve as a creative outlet and a vehicle for them to bring ideas, perspectives and change within their community.

#### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy these needs?

Current media outlets certainly inform their audiences/users. Select media contents creators feel a sense of self-actualization - their work does often reach a large audience, and can even bring modest fame. Streaming music services provide massive quantities of content to their users at a good price.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with this project?

Currently, media organization are centralized conglomerates. Major media outlets can provide high quality coverage, but can also be inaccessible and impersonal. Community solutions, as implemented through (relatively) cheap and reproducible digital methods, can remedy this problem through providing content and a community centered  platform. Importantly, community media outlets are self-sustaining through the efforts and contributions of community members. *By the community and for the community.*

[Media deserts are a well documented phenomenon...](https://mediadeserts.wordpress.com) Additionally, COVID-19 has demonstrated the importance of providing local information to community, and the need for a digital "town hall" when traditional gathering is interrupted.

### Target Users

*Characteristics of users:*
* college-aged, young adults
* access to internet connection
* digitally literate
* (For content creators) Enthusiasm for broadcasting/media

Context of Use:

Users will likely listen during commuting - this could include via car, walking, public transit. Additionally, users may listen at home on a smart device.

What would the users do to complete the activity?

Users would simply tune into the community/college radio station through a digital device. Additionally, the website would have to find the website navigable and engaging to fully fulfill this concept. At their discretion, users would browse community articles, content creator profiles, and be able to contact and interact with content creators.

### Observation Method
For this situation, I elected to perform an **Interview in context**. This involved prompting our user with some relevant questions and observing them perform relevant tasks.

### Interview Anecdotes of Interest

### *5:01*

#### *During preliminary questions on listening habits:* 
I don't listen to (conventional) radio, just because I mean, I don't like listen to the same songs on repeat 100 times.

### *6:16*

#### *Critique of user's primary music platform, Amazon Music:*
 I occasionally miss out on like, everybody's like sharing their Spotify stats, I'm like, oh, it'd be cool if I can see my stats, like, it's like, have a bit of a reflection on myself.

### *14:42*

#### *When prompted on improvements to blog content:* 
For college radio blog, I would just want them to have... I really liked how they haven't now like it's a fairly wide coverage like some artists I've never heard of, and I can appreciate that because it's like, I don't want to be like selfish and be like, Oh, I only want this one artist and like this genre. It's like, I feel like they should be covering as many like, sources as possible.

### *16:37*

#### *User attempting to navigate to show page and read show descriptions:*
 I click on a few of these and try to read them. I'm not able to scroll down on these, maybe I'm just doing something wrong. I don't seem to be able to scroll down these off. It's just my computer. I don’t see descriptions. 

#### *In response to problem:*
 I'm probably just…. as I said, judge a book by its cover and look at the covers because I can't really look at descriptions for some reason. Producer deep dive. I'm going to say this one because I really like the camera work. It's something that'd be relaxing and interesting, by DJ StuMu here.

### *20:00*

#### *When prompted on show page improvements:* 
Yeah, if possible. I would try to give the different shows like a subject matter or a genre, if you will, so that you can just like kind of feel it out and be like, oh, today I want a like, (a certain) perspective.

### *23:02*

#### *When asked how smaller media outlets can compete with major media companies:*
I would just say make the best quality you can and like share it with your friends and like just let that like slowly build because like you obviously can't get like the kind of advertisements these media companies can. But like at that level like at a student, college or college level you want to rely on like the people around you to spread the word.

I would say… I would say that they're (smaller vs larger media outlets) different. Audiences are different services. Like if I'm looking just to play some music in the car, like the shower, I'm just going to go to a streaming service. But if I want something more in depth, like more interesting, I'll listen to a show like, again, I'm gonna use your show as an example. Like there's like plenty of good music on there you play like I've never heard before and ever heard the artists before. And it's like, I'll go to your show or something like Interesting and like more, reflective-based.

### Reflection

The interview process was enjoyable. There were a couple issues with the script. Some questions weren't necessarily relevant to the user's experience with the website or prior experiences. In certain scenarios, I did deviate from the script... however, the process did feel very comfortable and conversational.

This user encountered a major technical issue when browsing the webpage. Show descriptions were not visible on the User's computer. Our user was using a smaller Chromebook. Also, this user made a useful suggestion about including a genre filter for the show page, and suggested a more universal search feature - extended beyond the blog page.

Our user also stressed that he did not see these community media platforms as direct competitors to one another, in the conventional sense. Rather, our user stressed the importance of community media containing differentiated, personable, idiosyncratic  content that can't be found in other platforms. They stressed social media, and other more localized means, as methods of promotion.
