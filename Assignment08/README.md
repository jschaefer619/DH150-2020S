# Community Building through Community Media
## Jack Schaefer

### Introduction
The increasing growth and consolidation of corporate media has led to an increasingly homogenous media landscape. This media landscape has led to political splintering, hostility, and distance. The time has come for communities to reclaim this space. 

But how can smaller scale media outlets compete with the lack of reasources? Volunterism can only go so far.

Regardless, college media - which is entirely student/community run - has persisted. But there is improvement to be made.

UCLA Radio is a strong media platform, with a strong on campus presence and a footing in the Los Angeles cultural scene. Because it is entirely online, the user experience of the website is crucial in determining the quality and overall potential of the platform.

So, this project is focusing on redesigning the UCLA Radio website for to fit this community building mission.

### Design statement
The UCLA Radio website does not promote it's power as musical tastemakers. This platform is not suited to compete with major streaming companies such as Spotify or Amazon music. However, the DJ's of UCLA Radio have curatorial power - this is music brought to the listener by an enthusiast, not the algorithm. 

As such, it is crucial that this platform allows for DJs to share their musical taste. Additionally, the website should allow for maximum DJ to listener interaction. Furthermore, The organization of the show schedule needed overhauling, and the landing page of the radio website was cluttered and uninspired.

Competitor Analysis
KXLU, a rival radio station - provided inspiration for many of the aesthetic improvements made to the redesign. Much was learned from the heurisitic analysis as well.
